<p align="justify">I am a fourth year dual degree (Bachelor's + Master's) student at IIT Bombay pursuing my academic major in Electrical Engineering. I hail from a small town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandausi">Chandausi</a>, located in Uttar Pradesh. It is a small but quiet place. I visit my hometown as and when I get time from my academics.

<br>
Automating my existence is what I strive for. It is the sole reason for most of the coding and tinkering I do. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, IoT (Internet of Things) are my keen interests. I am a Mathematics enthusiast who is highly intrigued by the beauty of this subject. The rest  of the programming I do is for helping out friends, and sometimes just for fun :).
<br>
<br>
In my spare time you can find me solving crossword puzzles or Sudoku, Watching TV series or taking a sound nap. I enjoy listening to music especially while working. I have always loved to read but have never been able to devote enough time to my books (I do have a collection though XD).

Over the period of my stay at IIT Bombay, I have learnt a lot through projects. Head over to the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section to check out my latest exploits. This place has also povided me with some of the best friends and YES! I have a bunch of them.
