I am a third year dual degree (Bachelor's + Master's) student at IIT Bombay pursuing my academic major in Electrical Engineering.

Automating my existence is what I strive for. It is the sole reason for most of the coding and tinkering I do. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, IoT (Internet of Things) along with Android Development and Mathematics are my keen interests. The rest is for helping out friends, and sometimes just for fun :).

In my spare time you can find me reading books, solving crossword puzzles, watching TV series. I also love listening to music while working. I like playing Table Tennis.

Over the period of my stay at IIT, I have learnt a lot through projects. Head over to the projects section to check out my exploits.

Blogging is a new experience for me and I'm surely loving it. I have recently started writing blogs. You can have a look <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog">here</a>.
