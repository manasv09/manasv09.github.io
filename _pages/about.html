<p align="justify">I was a dual degree (Bachelor's + Master's) student at IIT Bombay and pursued my academic major in
    Electrical Engineering. I am mostly interested in Machine Learning and its applications in our daily lives. My
    particular interest is in the field of computer vision and I completed my Dual Degee thesis on "Domain Adaptation
    for Semantic Segmentation in Satellite Images" in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Biplab Banerjee and
    co-supervision of Prof. Subhasis Chaudhri.

    Automating my existence is what I strive for. It is the sole reason for most of the coding and tinkering I do.
    Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and, IoT (Internet of Things) are my keen interests. I am a Mathematics
    enthusiast who is highly intrigued by the beauty of this subject. The rest of the programming I do is for helping
    out friends, and sometimes just for fun :).

    In my spare time you can find me solving crossword puzzles or Sudoku, Watching TV series or taking a sound nap. I
    enjoy listening to music especially while working. I have always loved to read but have never been able to devote
    enough time to my books (I do have a collection though XD).

    Over the period of my stay at IIT Bombay, I have learnt a lot through projects. This place has also povided me with
    some
    of the best friends and I have got a bunch of them.
